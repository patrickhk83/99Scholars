Given that the vast majority of the visual field is extra-foveal and that natural scenes are usually packed with features, our vision is dominated not by contrast sensitivity or acuity, but by crowding. Competing theories posit that crowding represents the limits of attentional resolution, some form of positional substitution or an averaging of features within large receptive fields. I will describe a series of studies showing that crowding modifies an object''s appearance once objects have entered phenomenal awareness and is not a substitution among neighboring features. While attention can modulate the level of crowding, equivalent noise analysis shows that crowding and attention are dissociable processes. A computational model is developed in which crowded perceptions represent mean image statistics within an eccentricity-dependent region. A reverse correlation paradigm is then used in an attempt to predict when crowding is likely in natural scenes.', 1382614200, 1382617800, 73, 56, NULL, 'Senior Scientist, Schepens Eye Research InstituteandAssociate Professor, Department of OphthalmologyHarvard Medicine School'),

This other-race effect in face recognition has been attributed to differences in holistic processing (Michel, et al., 2006; Tanaka, et al., 2004), in contact (Hancock & Rhodes, 2008; Rhodes et al., 2009), and in the motivation to individualize faces (Hugenberg, et al., 2010). Here I would like to present two studies that tested whether the other-race effect is dependent upon the relative engagement of holistic and feature processing at encoding. We manipulated face format at encoding so that the holistic processing was either disrupted or completely removed. The results showed that the other-race effect observed under normal face encoding was either eliminated or reversed (i.e., an other-race advantage). These results provide a strong support for an encoding-dependent accountof the other-race effect, which might also underlie the effects of racial contact and face individualization on the other-race effect observed in prior research.', 1370950200, 1370953800, 73, 56, NULL, 'Research Scientist, Human Cognition, Perception, and Action Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics'),

In study 1, event-related brain potential (ERP) correlates of the own-race bias (ORB) in groups of high-and low performing older adults were assessed to investigate potential dedifferentiation in early perceptual stages of face processing. The results suggest a neural compensation for age-related decline in high-performers, and demonstrate that even a less efficient face processing system exhibits preserved specialization towards own-race faces. Study 2 systematically tested whether daily-life contact can influence the occurrence of an own-age bias (OAB). Such result would argue for preserved plasticity of the face representational system in older age. Indeed, high contact to own-age persons was related to a behavioral OAB, which shows that older adults’ face representational system can adapt to environmental demands. Experiments 3 and 4 focused on source memory for familiar names. Source memory, as a form of associative memory, is often particularly impaired in older adults.By contrast, fluency-based processes, such as priming, are usually spared in older adults, and fluency-based processes have been recently shown to contribute to source memory. Acrossexperiments, an N400 ERP priming effect differentiated between the two possible sources of a previously presented familiar name (auditory versus visual learning modality) in both younger and older adults.

Within the last few decades, researchers have discovered other forms of rivalry, revealing it to be a general process of consciousness by which we deal with ambiguous input. The properties of rivalry have proved to be simpler and more general than imagined. Most of these properties are consistent with a simple theory, proposed in 1901, that visual consciousness of one picture occurs because neurons processing it are active and inhibit the activity of neurons processing the other and that the alternations in visual consciousness occur because adaptation of active neurons depresses their activity. All the properties of rivalry can be explained by adding the idea that processing occurs at different levels of the visual system linked by feed-forward and feedback connections.

By analyzing the detection and recognition efficiency,Chinese character recognition might follow a two-stage processing model—feature detection and featureintegration. The feature integration process was adversely influenced by internal crowding in peripheral vision.Secondly, the spatial frequency characteristics of recognizing Chinese characters of different complexitylevels were examined. The results showed that the peak tuning frequency for recognizing a more complexChinese character was higher and the bandwidth was narrower. In addition, it demonstrated different levels ofsize dependency in different complexity conditions. By comparing human data with data from a CSF-limited ideal observer, it implied that the processing mechanism of recognizing simple and complex characters wasdifferent. Thirdly, the importance of utilizing spatial frequency of different directions (i.e., horizontal and vertical) in Chinese character recognition was compared.

Examples are retinal and cortical scotomata, when large holes in the visual field should occur, but become invisible due to filling-in; neglect, when a large region such as ahemifield is ignored in the absence of any functional changes, causingus to bump into obstacles; color blindness, when certain hues are notseen because of one or more types ofphotoreceptors missing on the retina; motion blindness, when the perception of coherent motion is disturbed due to brain injury and all we see are changes of position; face blindness, when faces cannot be recognized because of a genetic defect or, more often, stroke; and blindsight, when we can navigateand successfully point towards invisible targets using the extrastriate pathway although we are cortically blind.

Thus,individuals in particular contexts can rely upon different combinations of intrapersonal and interpersonal cues inorder to understand, share, and respond adaptively to other''s feelings.', 1359977400, 1359981000, 73, 56, 0, 'Department of Youth & FamilyUtrecht UniversityThe Netherlands'),

Despite this, there have been few explicit attempts to directly target negative repetitive thought: standard CBT has tended to target the content of individual negative automatic thoughts rather than the overall process of repetitive negative thinking. In recent years, an increased understanding of the mechanisms underpinning repetitivenegative thinking has provided the opportunity for more innovative approaches to treat repetitive negative thought. For example, recent work has indicated that one key element within repetitive negative thought might be the processing style adopted during such thought. Such developmentshave resulted in two treatments that target repetitive negative thought: Rumination-focused CBT, which builds on a behavioral activation framework; and concreteness training, a guided self-help training utilizing a cognitive bias modification approach.

However, the learned rules cannot be applied to a new location or orientation automatically because the decision unit cannot functionally connect to new visual inputs that are likely suppressed by multi-session training and focused spatial/feature attention on trained location andorientation.

For example, we asked Japanese undergraduate students to answer theirpreferred control strategy when they face various interpersonal conflicts, which were described in vignettes (Sawaumi, Yamaguchi, Park, submitted). Consistent with the universality hypothesis that preference for primary control (i.e., control over environment)is universal across cultures, Japanese participants preferred to exert primary control strategies rather than secondary control. Furthermore, it was found that Japanese repertoire of primary control strategies is larger than it had been presumed: Japaneseemploy various primary control strategies, in addition to direct personal control (which is a prototypical primary control), when they are concerned about interpersonal harmony, such as indirect personal control, direct/indirect collective control, and proxy control. These results suggest that Asians attempt to exert control over environment in away that does not interrupt their harmonious relationships with others.

One particular area where attention is needed is fall accidents: injurious falls are among the most common potentially traumatic events of later life. They involve bodily harm, and some older adults may believe during the fall accident that their lives are threatened. As a result, fall-related injury can lead to anxiety so severethat it interferes with important aspects of recovery (full participation in physical rehabilitation, family and social relationships, and resumption of valued activities). This presentation will introduce an exposure-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) protocol (‘Back on My Feet’), which is one of the first study interventions to specifically address emotional recoveryfrom fall injury.

Participants with these anxiety conditions tend to use avoidance as a coping strategy to control physiological arousal and intrusive thoughts (memories of their fall accident or worries about falling again). The study intervention focuses on application of CBT techniques to reduce the core symptoms of avoidance, arousal, and re-experiencing.

They are: (i) seeing x, (ii) seeing x as S and (iii) seeing x by virtue of seeing y. According to this distinction, when I see that the gas tank is almost empty by seeing the gauge, I see x by virtue of seeing y. If, on the otherhand, I see a bright dot as a star, I see x as S. Finally, if I see a bright dot and I do not see it as a star, I simply see x. It is a common philosophical view that perceptual knowledge of other people’s emotions should be explained in terms of seeing x as S or, alternatively,in terms of seeing x by virtue of seeing y. In line with this view, if Mary is happy and she expresses it, I see her expression as one of happiness or, alternatively, I see her happinessby virtue of seeing her expression. In either case, I can see that Mary is happy only if I know (explicitly or otherwise) that there is a reliable correlation between characteristicexpressions and specific emotions. In this paper, I explore the alternative view that we see other people’s emotions in the sense of seeing x. My argument is two-fold. First, I argue that expressions are events that carry information about the emotions that produce them. Second, I develop a speculative account of the processes necessary to extract such information. This approach has three potential advantages. First, it may cast some light upon the role of low-level vision in the acquisition of a theory of mind.

At recognition time, a salience map is again generated and the extracted fixations compared with those in memory using Bayesian updates. The model parameters were tuned on Birds and Butterflies datasets, and then applied unchanged to Faces,Objects, and Flowers. This is in sharp contrast to most computer vision systems, which are usually tuned for the particular application. The model achieved state of the art performance for systems using a single feature type.Our approach achieves 78.5% accuracy on Caltech-101 and 75.2% on the 102 Flowers dataset when trained on 30 instances per class and it achieves 92.7% accuracy on the AR Face database with 1 training instance per person.

This talk will outline the perceptual problems encountered when a pedestrian standing at the kerb waiting to cross, or equivalently, a driver is waiting to pull out from a junction. I will then outline a series of experiments that measure perceptual thresholds for the detection of vehicle approach, and the discrimination of vehicle approach speed in a large typical road user population (~400 participants); in children ranging from 6-11years of age (~100 participants) and then in drivers over the age of 75 years. This will highlight that there is a problem that has arisen as a consequence of increasing transport speeds over the past 50 years that results in many typical road users having relatively poor discrimination of vehicle approach speeds. This in turn maylead to increased accident risk in some scenarios. The problem is inflated in the case of younger children and older drivers, such that the traffic speeds they can cope with are sometimes below the regulated traffic speeds in many urban areas. The issue of perceptual acuity and discrimination threshold also serves to explain why motorcyclists are over-represented in the accident statistics for vehicle collisions at junctions. Although “lack of attention” will certainly be the cause of some traffic accidents, attention is not just a top-downprocess but is also bottom-up and captured by salient stimuli arising in a road scene. Where perceptual stimuli are below anobserver’s threshold then they both fail to capture attention and also render any judgement of vehicle approach asunreliable. There are a number of factors thatdictate risk in traffic situations, such as driver aggression and conformity, but the take home message of this talk is that understanding visual processing is also essential to understanding the general limits of human performance and why those limits can be breached even in everyday traffic situations where road users are conforming to traffic regulations.', 1310556600, 1310560200, 73, 56, NULL, 'Department of PsychologyRoyal HollowayUniversity of LondonU.K.'),

In contrast, slower perception with focused attention is seen as a conscious return to lower cortical levels serially following reverse-hierarchy feedback connections to the ultimate sources of high-level activation, recovering detailed information available in the specialized receptive fields found there. This dual correspondence is especially apparent in the two modes of visual search: Spread-attention feature search (”what” without ”where”) derives not from low-level cortical areas as previously assumed, but from higher-level position-insensitive receptive fields.

However, the physical stimulus cannot always explain the phenomenology of what we see. Just think of visual illusions. Also, many stimuli are ambiguous and yet we see only one percept. Furthermore, in a complex scene, the retinal stimulus does not specify the relativecontributions by illumination, reflection, and transmission. The fact that percepts cannot be fully accounted for by knowledge of the stimulus is called the inverse optics problem. Nevertheless, we see sufficiently well in order to navigate, find food, and escape danger. The Gestaltists were well aware of these achievements and assigned visual perception an active role in parsing the visual input. Their approach is best captured by Koffka’s question:Why do we see the way we do and not differently? Furthermore: What is it that phenomenology is trying to tell us? Can we deduce the structuralfactors that govern figure-ground organization and grouping from simple observations?Numerous examples suggest that our perception is structured by inherent “laws” that are responsible for the way in which scenes are segmented, figures are segregated on the ground, and stimuliare grouped. These lawsof seeing (Metzger) are the so-called Gestalt factors of closure, smooth continuation, proximity, symmetry, and similarity under the overarching principle of good Gestalt or Praegnanz. The strongest factor is the factor of common fate that governs grouping in moving stimuli. All these factors were shown to be effective both in adults and children, although to different extents, and also in many species of animals. They are assumed to be largely innate and are considered laws of nature. While the Gestalt factors enable us to see, they are equally suited for hiding, for example, in camouflage.Powerful measures for hiding an object from perception are tearing up the uniformity of its surfaces, wrongly partitioning it and breaking up the borders through inappropriate continuations. The universality of the Gestalt laws in man and nonhuman species implies that the visual brains of such species are similar to ours.

I will demonstrate the complex relationship between the phonetic categories of a bilingual''s first and second languages and how sensitivity to the sociolinguistic context can determine the degree of interaction between languages. In an initial speech production study, bilinguals produced words containing stop consonants differing in voice onset time in monolingual language modes, and matched the productions of monolingual native speakers. Such findings are typically interpreted as evidence that bilinguals maintain their two languages separately and free of interference. I demonstrated that such interpretations may be premature in a follow-up study six months later, in which the same bilingual subjects produce the same target words but this time they were required to do so by switching languages (code-switching). The bilinguals'' earlier acquired first language, Greek, exerted an influence on the later acquired second language, English, demonstrating that even fluent bilingual speakers do not maintain their two languages completely independently and interaction occurs when both languages are activated. 2. It is often claimed that bilinguals learn a third language easier that monolinguals acquire a second. We tested this claim in an artificial language learning experiment in which bilinguals and monolinguals learned words that use phonetic distinction that systematically differ in the degree of similarity to those found in the groups'' native language(s). The findings show that bilinguals enjoy a general learning advantage for ''easy'' phonetic contrasts, but language-specific experience boosts learning of contrasts that are universally ''difficult''. 3.

The six-volume CEI covered a large range of topics, with the first two volumes dedicated almost solely to lexical items. The only transcription system available to T''ong was to represent the English words in Chinese characters intended to be pronounced by the Cantonese-speaking people. T''on used traditional Chinese fanqie and a few other diacritics of his own invention to overcome differences in phonotactics between Cantonese and English. Of particular interest to us is how T''ong cleverly used the tones of Cantonese to reflect the presence or absence of stress in the English words. Essentially, a study of lexical items recorded in the CEI revealed that the Cantonese transliterations of that period normally had higher tones, though not necessarily high tones, assigned to English syllables carrying stress. In modern basi- and mesolectal Hong Kong English (HKE) however, such ''stressed'' syllables now systematically are assigned high tones. Apparently, the use of higher tones to indicate stress has given way to a system where high tones are consistently used. Though it is unclear if modern HKE is tonal or pitch accentual, the stabilizing of tonal values suggests the potential evolution of HKE towards being a tone language. This process probably began with the contact between a tone language like Cantonese and a stress language like English, precipitating in a tone-stress hybrid like HKE. Evolution is a slow continual process with grey areas, and a comparison between CEI and modern HKE is about as clear a finding as one can ask for in identifying what might be two immediate steps in a long tenous process of language genesis.', 1363710600, 1363716900, 75, 60, 0, 'Hong Kong Baptist University'),

This talk attempts to address this issue by bringing together two studies (monolinguals and bilinguials) to test whether the perception of Cantonese lexical tone and English lexical stress arise from the interactions of linguistic features and language learning experience. Two experiments were designed to test young children and skilled adults from Hong Kong. Both tone identification and AXB discrimination paradigm were used. We have found that the perceptual saliency of lexical tone arises from the interaction of the acoustic and phonetic constituents. Bilingual adults performed better in lexical stress than lexical tones perception, but no difference was found between tone perception and stress perception in children, Our findings suggests that some common perceptual mechanisms that support for the distinction of lexical tones and lexical stress may exist and they are shaped by language experience.', 1359477000, 1359483300, 75, 60, 0, 'Division of Speech and Hearing Sciences, The University of Hong Kong'),

In contrast, recent research in my lab showed that compared with non-Chinese readers (i.e. novices), Chinese readers who had limited writing experience showed increased holistic processing, whereas Chinese readers who were also proficient writers showed reduced holistics processing. This result suggests that writing/sensorimotor experience can modulate holistic processing effects, and that the reduced holistic processing effect observed in expert Chinese readers may depend on writing experience. The left side bias effect has been consistently observed in face perception. We recently found that Chinese readers also have a left side bias in the perception of mirror-symmetric characters, whereas non-Chinese readers do not, suggesting that left side bias is an expertise marker for Chinese character recognition. This phenomenon is consistent with the finding that Chinese orthographic processing typically involves more RH processing as compared with English orthographic processing.

Figures from the 2011 census indicate that today, only 0.9 percent of the population in Hong Kong claim to use Hakka as their home language. While large-scale census surveys reveal overall trends indicating the rapid disappearance of the Hakka variety, smaller-scale enthnographic-based research in the community, as demonstrated in the current study, provides a richer insight into the actual dynamics of language shift. This study explores the language practices of individual speakers as the community shifts away from Hakka towards the use of Cantonese. Patterns of language choice and language use are examined using data collected through participant observation, informal interviews and conversational exchanges with members of the speech community in their homes.

Research has shown that code-switching is commonly used to index the bilingual''s social and/or ethnolinguistic identity, or various conversational meanings in ongoing discourse (e.g., selecting addressee(s), changing the topic, signaling despreference). In either case, referential meaning is generally regarded as more or less constant. To my knowledge there has been little empirical evidence of code-switching being attributed to the medium of learning and teaching. Empirical evidence was obtained from an experimental study involving 108 educated Chinese-English bilinguals in Hong Kong and Taiwan. The study, entitled ''One day with only Cantonese/Mandarin'', required student participants to use only their dominant community language for one day, and to avoid using any other language(s) (cf,''breaching experiments''/''revelation through disruption'', Harold Garfinkel 1967). Data arising from their rich and highly contextualized experiences were collected using two method: reflective diary and focus group. The primary objective of the project was to find out under what circumstances bilingual students would perceive a need to code-switch. A lot of instructive findings were obtained. This paper focuses on EMI-induced code-switching from Chinese to English by examining the code-switchers'' own accounts of the reasons why they found it so difficult to avoid instantiating field-specific terminologies when the conversation touched upon concepts that were learned and taught through English. Similarly difficult to avoid wre expressions belonging to what may be termed ''institutional discourse'', such as course and programme titles, administrative practices, academic departments and support services, etc. The tendency of cognitive dependence on English was clearly much stronger among participants in Hong Kong than in Taiwan.

For this, I designed a computer-based tutorial system with structured input, a large amount of practice opportunities, explicit feedback.

In Study I sixty-four advanced Chinese EFL learners received training on article cues presented in contrasting pairs. The participants were randomly assigned to one of the two feedback conditions that differed in terms of degree of explicitness: metalinguistic vs. exemplar feedback. Results showed that instruction promoted significant learning of article cues and particularly of idiosyncratic cues. There was no significant difference between metalinguistic and exemplar feedback. Study II had seventy-eight intermediate-advanced Chinese EFL learner participants. This experiment compared cue contrast with non-cue contrast instruction. It also examined whether the positive learning effects found in Study I could be enhanced through Bayesian Knowledge Tracing Model (Corbett and Anderson, 1995). Results indicated significant and retrained learning effects of article cues. There was no significant difference between different instructional conditions when all cues were considered. However, there was a significant interaction between cue contrast and the type of cues. Cue contrast promoted more learning of the poorly acquired cues, whereas non-cue contrast generated more balanced learning of all cues.

In addition, the lexicon interfaces with multiple components of grammar, such as semantics, syntax (e.g. part of speech), morphology (e.g. affixation and compounding), phonology (e.g. pronounciation, stress and truncation). Moreover, the lexicon offers a new perspective on two questions that are central to linguistics, namely, which aspects of language are universal and to what extent can languages differ from each other. In this talk, I report on a comparative study of the lexicons of English and Chinese. The study is of interest in several ways. First, English and Chinese are probably the two best studied languages, of which we have high-quality data that allow us to carry out quantitative analyses. Second, typologically, English and Chinese are quite different from each other, one being highly inflectional and the other hardly at all; therefore, they offer an ideal case for cross-language comparisons. Third, English and Chinese are probably two most widely used languages in the world; therefore, a better understanding them may have great pratical consequences. Compared with syntax, semantics, morphology, and phonology, theoretical linguists have paid much less attention to the lexicon. Therefore, I shall start with two simple questions, whose answers remain unclear: (a)What are the sizes of the English and Chinese lexicons?

The new SLA model views language acquisition as a social activity developed in interaction (Long, 2004; Mackey et al., 2003).

In contrast, the right hemisphere processes in a more stimulus-driven fashion, but also plays a critical role in linking language input to sensory imagery.

These findings predict that groups of listeners that differ in the distributions of sounds to which they are exposed in real-world speech perception should differ in identification and discrimination, too. This talk examines this possibility by studying the role of expose to children''s speech on individual''s performance on speech perception task. Acoustic-phonetic distributions of children''s speech differ from those adults for at least two reasons: Children produce stereotypical error patterns (i.e., the ''fronting'' of /k/ and /g/ to [t] and [k], in English-acquiring children), and children''s correct productions are acoustically more variable than those of adults. The first study (Munson, Johnson, & Edwards, submitted) examined relationships between experience interacting with children and the perception of fine acoustic detail in children''s speech. Individuals who self-reported more experience interacting with children (more-experienced listeners) perceived fine phonetic detail better than those of listeners with less experience interacting with children (less-experienced listeners). The second study (Julien & Munson, submitted) examined the propensity of adults to hyperarticulate productins to children whose speech they perceive to be inaccurate. More-experienced listeners were found to be more likely to hyperarticulate in response to hearing inaccurate production by a child than were less-experienced listeners. The third study (Christy, 2010, see also Munson, 2011) examined the perception of the accuracy of children''s speech when it was paired with pictures of African-American and European-American faces. For less-experienced listeners, there was a relationship between performance on a measure of implicit attitudes toward African-Americans and European-Americans and the extent to which the imputed race of the talker influenced ratings.

In this presentation, I report two sets of experiments targeting these two questions, including experiments examining the learning of lexical tones and phonological opacity by native English-speaking adults. Both sets of experiments suggest that the large individual variability in language learning success can be attributed to genetic, neurobiological, perceptual, and/or cognitive factors. Furthermore, re-designing training based on these predictors can sometimes optimize learning. For example, training programs that take advantage of phonetic-phonology continuity and reducing the degree of phonetic-indexical variation can benefit the weaker (but not stronger) learners. Training that increasing trial-by-trial feedback can further improve the learning of learners with high (but not low) procedural memory ability.

These participants, however, viewed their differentiated status as somewhat precarious, for accompanying their repeated reports of attempting to stand out through English use was a frequently expressed anxiety about the fact that their English abilities alone might not continue to adequately differentiate them from others, particularly in the employment arena, as more and more Taiwanese gain English proficiency.', 1378288800, 1378292400, 76, 61, 0, 'Post-doctoral Fellow, Nanyang Technological University'),

The Egyptian sociolinguistic setting is usually defined in terms of a diglossic continuum, the main poles of which are Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and Egyptian Colloquial Arabic (ECA). It is, however, being significantly reconfigured by the increasing socio-economic importance of English, a linguistic variety with a strong stratifying force due to its high value on the contemporary Egyptian neo-liberal (linguistic) market.While the hegemonic ideological projection postulates writing as the domain of MSA, the actual literacy practices are anything but uniform. Non-literary, vernacular, texts, in particular, more often than not tend to result from a range of motivated, locally meaningful – metrolingual and translingual – acts of writing in which people draw on a variety of available resources. The inventory of these resources contains re-combinations of three linguistic varieties (MSA, ECA and English) and two scripts (Arabic and Roman), thus potentially becoming sixfold - which moves us beyond the simplistic dualism implied in the notion of diglossia.The analysis of linguistic details is conducted with reference to a broader socio cultural context and local language ideologies surrounding this dynamic, changing and diversified character of writing practices in present day Egypt. I provide illustrative examples from a number of different texts and domains of writing, including books, Wikipedia Masry (Wikipedia written in Egyptian Arabic), Twitter, Facebook, advertisements, online campaigns for political and social causes, graffiti, revolutionary signs, placards and banners. I discuss these contemporary literacy practices in terms of heteroglossic indexing of contesting identity positions, which is understood as an activity informed by different patterns of sociolinguistic consumption and enacted in what I term “spaces of sociolinguistic freedom”.', 1365082200, 1365085800, 76, 61, 0, 'Andrew W Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow in Arabic Sociolinguistics'),

In a privileged position to impact on policy-making in multiethnic societies, acculturation research has suffered from methodological limitations, often pointed out at as an excessive reliance on second-hand quantitative data collected by means of questionnaires. Such data have been criticized for providing a simplified picture of acculturation trends without accounting for unquantifiable manifestations of emergent cultural identities promoted by interethnic contact. On the basis of quantitative and qualitative studies of language variation across the Black/White divide in the United States, I take the view that interactional sociolinguistic data form adequate first-hand data for quantitatively and qualitatively reconstructing collective acculturation trends, namely ‘assimilation’ (whereby the original cultural identity is relinquished in favour of the dominant cultural identity), ‘integration’ (whereby the original cultural identity and the dominant cultural identity are jointly held), and ‘separation’ (whereby the original cultural identity is retained to the exclusion of any other cultural identity). On the basis of a semi-experimentally set up interaction involving Namibian Whites and Namibian Coloureds, I will present the potential and limits of concepts developed in interactional sociolinguistics, namely ‘convergence’, ‘divergence’ and ‘maintenance’, for reconstructing social dynamics governing interethnic contact and their correlation with acculturation trends. This practical demonstration precedes an outline of research projects on interethnic interaction which I wish to undertake in ethnically mixed school environments in two distinct urban contexts, namely Cape Town and Singapore. I will finally launch a discussion with the audience about whether the linguistic predictions which can be made with regard to interethnic acculturation trends in Cape Town’s school environment can also be made for Singapore.', 1359972000, 1359975600, 76, 61, 0, 'Research Fellow, National Research Foundation, Flanders/Vrije Universiteit Brussel'),

But whether their surface fundamental frequency (F0) contours are purely from lexical tones or a combination of tone and intonation has not been fully shown experimentally. Detailed analyses of ten Cantonese SFPs in the present study show that most of these SFPs are very similar to the lexical tones in terms of F0 contours, but differences can be seen in sentences with question SFPs, suggesting that the Cantonese SFPs have underlying tonal targets just like those of lexical tones, but they also carry intonational meanings by modification of the lexical tonal contours.Recent research shows that Beijing Mandarin marks focus not only by on-focus prosodic expansion but also by post-focus compression of pitch range and intensity (PFC), but PFC is absent in Taiwanese and Taiwan Mandarin. This finding highlights the non-universality of PFC and raises questions about its origin. The present study investigates the acoustic correlates of prosodic focus in Cantonese by Hong Kong speakers, and those in English and Cantonese by bilingual speakers born and raised in Southern England. PFC, which occurs in English, is not found in the Cantonese of both groups of speakers, but out of the fifteen bilinguals tested, only one-third show PFC in all their English test sentences, suggesting that PFC is hard to transmit across languages through bilingualism.', 1364481000, 1364484600, 76, 61, 0, 'Teaching Fellow, Department of Chinese and Bilingual Studies, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University'),

(399, 463, 'Dr. Luca Onnis', 'One of the central goals in linguistics is to understand how humans learn and use language. To this purpose, three factors are to be identified: (a) the nature of the input experienced by the learner (both linguistic and extra-linguistic), (b) the types of computations learners make in analyzing the input, and (c) the biases and constraints that operate on these computational processes. The interaction of these three factors is considered fundamental to understanding how language knowledge rapidly emerges in children, as well as how language processes differ in childhood and adulthood. In this talk I will present a particular case of interaction between input and computations that generates constraints on later learning.In empirical studies carried out with infants and adults I document how experiencing a language with a given word order structure (head-initial versus head-final) can modify the computations that are carried out on novel language-like structures. I show that infants quickly become attuned to the most informative sequential regularities of their native language in the first years of life. This in turn may support the fast discovery of word order and phrase structure – a fundamental milestone in language acquisition. Such parsing biases reflect general language-specific statistical regularities latent in large corpora. These biases can be shown to persist in adult learners, potentially explaining some of the difficulties involved in learning a novel language with different word order structure.Adult brains however retain a large plasticity potential. Contrary to strong assumptions of critical periods in development, research in cognitive neuroscience now supports the idea of a permanently plastic brain. An exciting open question is thus whether training interventions can be designed that modify the learners’ entrenched experience by retuning learning mechanisms to the regularities of a novel language. Evidence of cognitive modifiability and plasticity in adults could promote new approaches to learning and teaching languages. Together, my behavioral and computational results shed light on experience-driven constraints on learning and plasticity in language acquisition.', 1364896800, 1364900400, 76, 61, 0, 'Center for Second Language Studies, University of Hawaii'),

Following the thought-provoking cross-semiotic analogy of translation as kung fu (John Minford, 1997), I shall here characterize translation, which inevitably brings two languages into intimate contact if not violent combat, more specifically as ‘pushing hands’ between the source and the target language driven by each other’s ‘articulate energy’ (Donald Davie, 1955). The process is initiated by an advancing flow of energy from the source language which is instantiated, realized, and confined in a finite ‘source text’. In response to this ‘foreign’ energy, the target language, through the agency of a translator, mobilizes its articulate potential to ensure a budiu buding state of contact, so as to follow the flow of the oncoming energy and to accommodate, absorb, and contain it in the formulation of a new text. We will then argue that the flexibility and agility of the articulate energy a language demonstrates in this game of pushing hands comes from its textual function of information structuring, which is sustained by its lexicogrammatical system as ‘a theory of human experience’ (M.A.K. Halliday, 1999). As such, on a micro level, following the movement of information focus as the ‘contact point’ may help maintain a budiu buding mode of translation to capture, accommodate, and contain the oncoming energy as the source text unfolds, and redirect it into an emerging target text.', 1353074400, 1353078000, 76, 61, 0, 'Department of Chinese, Translation and Linguistics, City University of Hong Kong'),

Less well-known is the Habitat model (Leitner 2004a/b). Though often discussed as if they covered the same ground, these conceptualizations have emerged at different periods of time and describe different features of English. The Habitat model is perhaps the most demanding as it embeds English in the wider spectrum of languages and societies and takes the reciprocity of language contact (more) seriously. It integrates the duality of changes – those towards greater homogeneity at the international level and those towards diversity at the national level.

Furthermore, the very long-distance anaphor seems to violate the Locality Condition (Dalrymple 1991), which states that "constraints on anaphoric binding are local; binding constraints never refer exclusively to nonlocal elements".

The enclitic no typically marks actors in transitive clauses that display a high degree of agentivity, i.e. volitionality and purpose, while the enclitic ye typically marks actors in transitive clauses that display a low degree of agentivity. In addition to these functions, no can mark contrastive focus on an argument, while ye can mark the topic of a non-transitive clause, placing contrastive focus on the predicate. However, it will be shown that it is not always easy to tease apart the semantic and pragmatic functions of these two markers. An analysis of no and ye is complicated by the fact that both markers (or arguably, homophonous markers with the same pragmatic functions) can occur with non-core arguments.', 1349193600, 1349197200, 76, 61, 0, 'Visiting Research Fellow, Australian National University'),

For some, grammatical processing is qualitatively different in a second and native language (Shallow processing hypothesis: Clahsen & Felser 2006); whereas for others, the fundamental mechanisms of L1 and L2 grammatical processing are the same (Dekdtspotter, Schwartz & Sprouse 2006; Herschensohn 2000; Hopp 2007; Schwartz & Sprouse 1996), with processing differences being attributable to factors such as reduced automaticity (slowness) of L2 processing (Frenck-Mestre 2002; 2005), the influence of L1 properties (Prévost & White 2000; Foucart & Frenck-Mestre 2011, 2012; Frenck-Mestre et al. 1997; Hopp, 2007) and limited computational resources (McDonald 2006). In the present talk we will show that the adult learner indeed goes through developmental stages in the acquisition of the target grammar, which can be tracked via the neural response to grammatical and ungrammatical structures. We will show that during early stages of L2 acquisition, the automatic neural response elicited during online syntactic processing is qualitatively different than that found for either more advanced learners or native speakers. At more advanced stages of learning coupled with immersion however, the differences in the neural response observed between native and non-native speakers during syntactic processing are quantitative rather than qualitative in nature. We will argue from these data that, indeed, full acquisition of grammatical competence is possible even for languages learned “late” in life, while not undermining the various factors that impinge upon processing capacity.', 1327075200, 1327078800, 76, 61, 0, 'Centre National de Recherche, Scientifique Universités d’Aix-Marseille'),

The tendency to group showed little categorical bias. In a second case, we analyzed results from two prior studies of hue scaling of chromatic stimuli to test whether color appearance changed more rapidly around the blue‐green boundary. In this task observers tended to show much stronger categorical effects. The differences between these tasks could arise either because different signals mediate color grouping and color appearance, or because linguistic categories might differentially intrude on the response to color and/or on the perception of color. Our results suggest that the interaction between language and color processing may be highly dependent on the specific task and cognitive demands and strategies of the observer.

Individual differences in phonetic learning ability have been thus far attributed to cortical circuitry.

For this purpose, we tested children and adults speaking a classifier language, Chinese and Japanese, and those speaking German, a non-classifier language, on a range of tasks including categorization, similarity judgment, novel label extension, property induction, and object individuation.

Communication relies crucially on this inferential ability, but language is not necessary for communication. Language can aid in communication, though, by helping to constrain the inferential process of the addressee. The inferential process can be more or less constrained, and language structure (both words and grammar) arises as speakers use the same forms to constrain the addressee''s interpretation in the same way, until they become habits on the individual level and conventions at the societal level. Language and its use is then culture (societal conventions for carrying out particular activities), much like other aspects of what we normally think of as culture and human behaviour, and is governed by the same principles. What we think of as the meaning of language structures is our experience of the use of those forms in constraining the interpretation in a particular way. Languages differ in terms of which semantic fields they obligatorily constrain the interpretation of, to what extent they constrain them, and what lexical or grammatical means they use to constrain them. Each language then is unique, as it reflects the patterns of use of its unique speaker community which are determined by the cognitive categories and culture of the speakers.', 1288798200, 1288801800, 76, 61, 0, 'Research Centre for Linguistics Typology, La Trobe University, Australia');

Consequently specialists are in the position of having to find arguments in support of a homeland in locations where little or none on the diversity of the Austroasiatic phylum is found today.Instead, Dr. Sidwell suggest that the marked geographical clustering of Austroasiatic languages along the course of the Mekong river indicates that proto-Austroasiatic speakers inhabited a riverine corridor overlapping modern NE Thailand and Southern Laos, from which they radiated in NW and SW trajectories.

Evidence of coarticulatory effects of one sign on another were found across up to three intervening signs, though they were generally weaker than the effects found in the parallel spoken-language study. This difference appears to be due in part to greater variability among these signers in their articulary behaviour, relative to that users of spoken language.A perception experiment using stimuli derived from filmed excerpts of the sign production experiment showed that both death signers and hearing non-signers were sensitive to the sign-based coarticulatory efforts, though again to a lesser degree than has been found for listeners in comparable spoken-language studies.

In this talk, Dr. Antoine address the question of whether lexical bundles taken in their referential form are stored and/or processed holistically.In self-paced reading experiments and word and sentence recall experiments, Dr. Antoine demonstrate that sentences containing non-idiomatic LBs (e.g. in the middle of the) are read faster and are remembered more easily than control sentences containing low-frequency sequences (e.g., in the front of the).

The reference of him in (1), for example, seems to refer to either Bill or John depending on whether the primary stress is placed on George or him or him, respectively.(1) John hit Bill, and then George hit him.In a prevailing approach to this phenomenon, each pronoun is associated with some default reference, and pitch accentuation has the effect of ''switching'' its reference to some alternative (Kameyama 1999). While intuitively appealing, such a view does not readily integrate with independently movtivated theories of pitch accent meaning (e.g., Pierrehumbert & Hirschberg 1991). In an alternative approach, the phenomenon can be explained by the semantically structured presuppositions (e.g., contrastive focus) that are associated with patterns of accentuation and phrasing over utterances.In this talk, Dr. James reports on a series of studies that seek to distinguish between these two approaches directly. First, a production experiement compares the adequacy of the two approaches in predicting the accentual status of pronouns from context. Two related experiments distinguish between the two approaches when viewed as strategies for resolving ambiguous pronouns in perception. Together, the findings support a rejection of the ''switching'' approach in favor of one based on inferencing from focus presuppositions.

Prenatal exposure to androgens is known to affect fetal brain maturation and later neurocognitive function. However, research on the effects of prenatal androgen exposure has been limited by indirect measures of androgens (e.g. 2D:4D ratio) and small unrepresentative samples. The first aim of my research was to investigate whether circulating fetal testosterone concentrations are associated with language development in early childhood. This was examined in a large-scale prospective pregnancy cohort, using umbilical cord blood as a surrogate measure of prenatal testosterone exposure. The second aim of my research is to investigate a possible neurobiological mechanism underlying the relationship between fetal testosterone concentrations and language development.

In my presentation I will report two aspects of bridging the boundaries between science and arts in this tradition of exploring the foundations of human perception. Firstly, I will review a body of psychophysical and oculomotor experiments, combined with computational modelling, to understand the motion illusions perceived in Op Art paintings, such as Bridget Riley''s ''Fall''. Computer generated versions of such simple Black-and-White patterns, called ''riloids'', are used to investigate systematically the conditions under which such illusions are observed. Measuring the eye movements made by human observers while watching the same kind of stimuli identifies small involuntary micro-saccades as essential drivers to perceive such illusory motion. A computational model of motion perception can join these two types of observations together into a full explanation of how the motion illusion is generated by riloids, offering a clear rationale to explain the basic mechanisms underlying many of such illusions in their most fundamental configurations, and opening the debate as to whether they can account for other motion illusions experienced in more intricate patterns, such as Leviant''s ''Enigma'' or Kitaoka''s ''Rotating Snake''. Secondly, I will report a recent line of research that attempts to measure aesthetic judgements objectively and quantitatively, which is based in Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) of the type applied to complex design optimization problems in engineering. Most importantly, this well established method is combined in Gaze Driven EA (GDEA) with the analysis of eye movements made by participant exploring the visual aspects of different designs, which is then used as ''evolutionary driver'' to identify individual preferences. The validity of this method is demonstrated by testing simple artistic composition rules, such as the Golden Section or Colour-Shape associations, and tested in a variety of ''artwork'', including the design of commercial packaging. In our current work we are investigating whether the composition of Mondrian paintings can be captured and evaluated with GDEA.', 1362485700, 1362490200, 77, 62, NULL, 'Department of Psychology, Royal Holloway, University of London.'),

Yet, because emotion perception has open been studied using facial expressions in isolation, we know little about how this important social skill develops. This talk presents data that explores to what extent children (8-12 years) show early and mandatory integration of context and expression information, in a non-predictive gaze-cueing paradigm. Brie?y, children and adults decided whether animals that were looked-at (or away from) by fearful and happy faces were safe or dangerous. The animal stimuli and required response (i.e., safe vs. dangerous) were designed to invoke a potentially threatening environmental context, meaning that fearful expressions were more relevant in this context than happy expressions. Integration of context and expression was measured as (a) greater gaze-cueing from fearful expressions than from happy expressions, and (b) facilitation of responses by fearful expressions to dangerous animals versus safe animals. Results indicate that 8 to 12 year old children do have some capacity for early and mandatory integration of context and expression, which can drive ships in attention and behavioural responses. This capacity however seems to decline rapidly as processing becomes more volitional (i.e., at longer SOA duration). The difficulties children show with integrating context and expression in later volitional stages of processing may contribute to errors in emotion perception and, thus, less adaptive social responses.', 1366804800, 1366808400, 77, 62, NULL, 'PhD Candidate, Research School of Psychology, Australian National University.'),

When we looked beyond to our understanding of visual priming, visual search, and visual motion, we found that this new perspective had profound influences there as well.

Police are allowed to testify as ‘ad hoc experts’ to the accuracy of their own transcripts of barely audible listening device recordings.

However, speech perception among implanted persons varies widely, from star to very limited performance. The research reported here aims at optimizing speech perception for people not in the star category. According to Loizou et al (1998, JASA 103, p. 1141ff), part of the problem is an impaired ability to track frequency changes in the speech signal as these changes constitute important information for perceiving differences between speech sounds. A cochlear implant is, at maximum, a 22-channel information transmitter, where a channel is composed of a band-pass filter and its corresponding electrode. A frequency allocation table is used to assign the band-pass limits to each band-pass filter. These tables are provided by the manufacturer and are, so to speak, the default tables. In this study, we changed these tables so that more channels would be assigned to the frequency range of 1000-3000 Hz, where many changes occur in the frequency content of the speech signal (experimental tables). Newly implanted patients were tested using the default and experimental tables on various speech perception tasks, most importantly the CNC word perception task, an open set and difficult task. Overall, there were no differences in performance. However, five of the nine subjects preferred the new tables for everyday listening, one was indifferent, and three preferred the default tables. In addition, closer inspection of the confusion matrices for each condition showed significant improvement using the experimental tables in the perception of stop consonants, especially for velar stops, which are not lip-readable.', 1361959200, 1361966400, 77, 62, 0, 'Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders, University of Wisconsin.'),

We compare the performance of children with a cochlear implant with that of chronologically age-matched (CA) children.

The area of morphosyntax as measured by clitic (phonologically weak pronoun) production is particularly vulnerable and shows age of implantation effects.

I will illustrate how multivariate pattern classification approaches (MVPA) for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) data can be used to predict choice outcomes directly from patterns of brain activity. First, I will show how this method can be used to predict perceptual decisions under high and low discriminability, even when stimuli do not provide discriminative information. Then, I will then provide examples for how MVPA can be used to investigate internally motivated choices, linking perceptual guessing decisions and so-called free decisions, by investigating the similarity of their underlying activation patterns. I will further show how the same analysis techniques applied to event-related potentials (ERPs) can be used to link perceptual decisions under low discriminability to pre-stimulus brain activity. This approach allows understanding early predictive brain activity as the starting point setting in an evidence accumulation model framework. Finally, I will extend the EEG-based MVPA approach to the analysis of post-decision neural processes and show that it can also be used to predict decision errors from brain signals prior to response execution.

Perhaps because most children learn to talk so easily, the traditional view of phonological development has focused on children''s acquisition of abstract phonological categories such as phonemes, distinctive features, or markedness and faithfulness constraints, depending on the linguistic theory that is in vogue. Such a view of phonological development makes many assumptions: for example, it assumes that children''s phonological learning is best described in terms of alphabetic transcription and that patterns of phonological development are similar across different languages.

We present experimental data from Chilean Spanish (ChS) and Brazilian Portuguese (BrP), two languages in which there is significant sociolinguistic variation in the production of plural morphology but which also differ parametrically in the licensing of bare count nouns in argument position. We argue tha the acquisition patterns in the two languages differ, but are consistent with the idea that input variability may cause ambiguity and delay acquisition of categorical properties. In both ChS and BrP, lack of plural morphology in the NP does not guarantee that the referent is to be interpreted as a singleton (one) or as a mass term. In ChS syllable-final /s/ is subject to a lenition process that reduces [s] to [h] or zero. This also affects the realization of plural /-s/, resulting in the syntactic plural feature sometimes realized as zero. In BrP, agreement is also subject to variation, but the variation is restricted to number and person morphology which is sometimes not overtly realized, again causing ambiguity. In both languages, the variability is probabilistic and dependent on both linguistic and extralinguistic factors (e.g., syntactic category and social class). While the ChS variability is, for the adult, a low level phonetic variability, the BrP variability targets agreement only (Miller 2007; Cepeda 1995; Pereira & Scherre 1995). Additionally, in BrP but not in ChS, numberless bare count nouns can appear in subject and object positions with a singular or plural interpretation depending on the context (Schmitt & Munn 2003). ChS bare count nouns are only allowed in a restricted set of contexts (objects of possession verbs, for example) (Espinal & McNally 2011). This fact provides more evidence to the child that lack of plural does not always mean singular-one in BrP than in ChS. In this paper I present three studies examining the interpretation of plural morphology and its absence in three contexts in both Brazilian Portuguese and Chilean Spanish. Study 1 examines children''s ability to use number to make count/mass distinctions in comparative contexts such as (1). (1) Quem tem mais corda/cordas? (Brazilian Portuguese) Who has more string/strings? Study 2 examines children''s ability to interpret bare count singulars and bare plurals in contexts such as (2). (2) Que menina tem livro/livros? (Brazilian Portuguese) Which girl has book/books? Study 3 examines children''s ability to interpret the indefinite singular and the indefinite plurals in contexts such as (3). (3) Dá um livro/uns livros pra tartaruga. (Brazilian Portuguese) Give a book/some books to the turtle. The results show that both the language and the type of variability matter. Plural morphology is ignored more often by Chilean Spanish speaking children than Brazilian children. On the other hand, and much as predicted by the parametric variation, lack of plural morphology does not guarantee a one interpretation in the bare count noun experiment and the mass/count experiment more often for Brazilian children than for Chilean Spanish speaking children. I examine the results with respect to current analyses of the plural and analyses of bare singulars/bare plurals in both languages.', 1358251200, 1358258400, 77, 62, NULL, 'Linguistics & Germanic, Slavic, Asian and African Languages, Michigan State University.'),
(497, 561, 'Professor Niels Schiller', 'This talk will be about how we plan and produce speech. More specifically, how do we put together words and sentences and what are the linguistic units that need to be activated and retrieved from long-term memory. For instance, words can consist of smaller meaningful elements called “morphemes”, e.g. the Dutch compound vaatwasser (‘dishwasher’) consisting of vaat (‘dirty dishes’) and wasser (derived from wassen ‘to wash, to clean’). How do we represent words like vaatwasser in our memory – as one holistic entity or do we also store the elements vaat and wasser separately? The present study investigated morphological priming in Dutch as well as its time course and neural correlates in overt speech production using a long-lag priming paradigm. Prime words were compounds (e.g. the word jaszak, ‘coat pocket’) that were morphologically related to a picture name (e.g. jas ‘coat’) or form-related monomorphemic words (e.g. jasmijn, ‘jasmine’ for jas). The morphologically related prime compounds could be semantically transparent (e.g. eksternest, ‘magpie nest’) or opaque (e.g. eksteroog, lit. ‘magpie eye’, but meaning ‘corn’ on a toe, for a picture of a magpie, Dutch ekster). Behavioral (reaction time), event-related potential (ERP) and functional neuroimaging (fMRI) data were collected in separate sessions. The production of morphologically related and complex words facilitated subsequent picture naming and elicited a reduced N400 compared with unrelated prime words. The effects did not differ for transparent and opaque relations. Mere form overlap between a prime word and a target picture name did not affect picture naming. These results suggest that morphological priming in language production cannot be reduced to semantic and/or phonological processing. Moreover, morphologically related but not form-related words led to a neural priming effect in the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG). The time course of these priming effects as reflected in the ERP measure is in accordance with a meta-analytic temporal estimate of morphological encoding in speaking. The neuroimaging results point to a functional role of the LIFG in morphological information processing during language production contrary to previous meta-analytic findings, since the effects seem to be independent of semantic overlap. It is suggested that the LIFG subserves word form encoding in language production.', 1352736000, 1352741400, 77, 62, NULL, 'Leiden Institute for Brain and Cognition and Leiden University Center for Linguistics, Leiden University, The Netherlands.'),

Researchers have largely overlooked these so-called sensory symptoms but their prominence in forthcoming diagnostic criteria calls for systematic investigation and explanation. In this talk, I suggest that the sensory and other non-social symptoms in autism might be caused by important differences in what an autistic person expects about incoming sensory signals and therefore how they interpret their significance. Within a Bayesian framework, I suggest that attenuated Bayesian priors – hypo-priors – may be responsible for the unique perceptual experience of autistic people, leading to a tendency to perceive the world more accurately rather than modulated by prior experience.

However, research to date has focused primarily on explicit tests of recognising other people''s emotions and inferring the likely contents of other people''s thoughts. Yet much of social cognition is automatic and very little is known of these more automatic facets of socia cognition in schizophrenia. One automatic facet of this type involves the spontaneous detection of other people''s direction of gaze and reflexive shifts of attention in the same direction. These capacities are critical for acts of ''shared attention'', a very basic meeting of minds where two individuals share the same focus of attention. Some preliminary evidence suggests that detecting and orienting to signals of other people''s gaze direction is hyper-sensitive in people with schizophrenia, however, the findings are mixed to date. I will present a number of studies using spatial orienting tasks to investigate gaze processing in people with schizophrenia.

There are independent genetic influences on word reading and language comprehension, and the genetic and environmental influences on comprehension skills assessed in preschool before learning to read can predict later reading comprehension problems. But the source of poor performance on tests lies not just in factors related to the reader. This talk will invite you to consider what might be wrong not just with the test-taker, but also with the tests. Despite all tests being called reading comprehension assessments, there are considerable differences across tests in the skills being assessed. We will show how test results depend on how comprehension is assessed, so that a reader can appear to have shortcomings when assessed with one test but not with another.

These models are intuitively appealing, and suggest that attention effectively increases the intensity of important stimuli in a manner analogous to turning up the volume knob on a stereo. Using the early visual system as a model, I will use fMRI and a novel analytic approach to show that attention modulates the gain of the most informative sensory neurons given whatever specific perceptual task confronts the observer.

Whereas primary sign languages operate with little or no connection to speech, these ‘alternate’ sign languages are used in various contexts by people who also use spoken language. They are culturally valued and highly endangered, yet until recently there has been little or no systematic documentation of these sign languages since Kendon (1988). In everyday conversation sign is used for particular cultural and pragmatic reasons. At one end of a continuum, female bereaved kin may use sign to replace speech during extended periods of mourning, such as when a widow is under a speech ban. At the other end of this continuum, all members of the community may use sign to supplement other modes of communication and to replace speech when talk is not practical or desirable. Sign is used when hunting (as noise would scare off prey) and for communication between interlocutors who are a long way away from each other. Using sign demonstrates the respect required of certain cultural situations. Sign may also be employed for specific medical reasons, and for some speech and/or hearing impaired individuals sign is the primary mode of communication. In this paper I outline some of the features of sign languages used in Arandic language speaking communities. In particular I will focus on the ways that reciprocal and plural meanings are expressed.

This research aims to investigate the effect of additional visual cues on auditory evoked potentials and fields when listening in background noise in school-aged children with APD. Two groups of children (aged 7-12) participated in this study 12 controls and 10 children diagnosed with APD. EEG and MEG data were recorded concurrently to the natural speech token /ba/ presented as auditory, visual or audiovisual stimulation imbedded in 8-talker babble at +10 and +3dB SNR. Independent component analysis (ICA) was performed on the EEG data through the EEGLAB toolbox (EEGLAB, San Diego, CA) under the public GNU license (Delorme and Makeig, 2004). MEG data was pre-processed and exported using BESA v.5.3. Cortically constrained source estimates of the EEG and MEG activity were then conducted using the sLORETA algorithm (implemented in using Curry version 6.0.20, Compumedics Neuroscan, Charlotte, NC for the EEG and Brainstorm v3.1; Tadel et al., 2011 for the MEG) assuming a generalized Boundary Element Model (BEM) (OpenMEEG; Gramfort et al, 2010; Kybic et al, 2005).

Rather, there appear to be a number of common genetic variants, each of which has a small impact on reading ability, and which in combination can lead to someone being unusually good or poor at reading. The same is true for the other neurodevelopmental disorders. Furthermore, the different types of problem commonly co-occur, so children can end up with multiple diagnoses.

Shape aftereffects provide a good test of this, as many different retinal images can create the impression of the same real-­world shape (imagine looking at the top of a coffee mug from many different angles). I will show new evidence that shape aftereffects follow perceived, not retinal shape, demonstrating that even apparently simple shape aftereffects reflect the computations required to transform variable retinal images of a common object into a stable impression of form. Second, do high-level aftereffects simply reflect a contrast between successive impressions, or do they indicate a process of normalisation (as in colour adaptation), where an internal ‘average’ is re-adjusted to better match recent experience? Using a novel paradigm, I compared the characteristics of aftereffects generated by adapting to colour, to expanded or contracted faces, and to male or female faces.

Multivariate analysis using Goldvarb X (Sankoff, Tagliamonte & Smith 2005) indicates that—although some constraints like the favouring effect of first person subjects behave similarly across the generations and are in line with other Englishes—Australian be like is subject to different constraints across generations of young speakers. Pre-adolescent and adolescent girls are active agents of language change by upping be like’s frequency and its use with the historical present in narratives.

Firstly, I will consider whether sonority is a useful theoretical construct for understanding children’s patterns of consonant cluster generalization in monomorphemic contexts (e.g., skip, play, tree).

For instance, despite being able to recognise a newly learnt name for a given referent, children can struggle to name the same referent. Children with specific language impairment (SLI) find word learning particularly challenging. In this talk, I will present the results of a slow mapping study involving children with and without SLI.

We find that adding a total dependency length feature to a comprehensive realization ranking model yields statistically significant improvements in BLEU scores and significantly reduces the number of heavy/light ordering errors, many of which are egregious. Through distributional analyses, we also show that with simpler ranking models, dependency length minimization can go overboard, too often sacrificing canonical word order to shorten dependencies, while richer models manage to better counterbalance the dependency length minimization preference against (sometimes) competing canonical word order preferences.

This research deals with the processing of two spatially distributed words. A different perspective arises in masked priming, which deals with temporally distributed words. In these experiments, priming effects are obtained with a 50 ms prime-target SOA, and the existence of phenomena such as cross-language translation priming, and congruence effects in semantic categorization tasks indicates that the prime must have been interpreted semantically. However, it is estimated that at least 150 ms is needed to retrieve the meaning of a word. This suggests that the prime continues to be processed after the target has been presented, which is support for parallel processing. Current models of visual word recognition have difficulty explaining how this is possible, since the activation produced by the target would suppress activation produced by the prime. New experiments will be described which examine the effect of inserting a brief intervening stimulus between the prime and the target.

Since lexical tone is defined as the use of pitch variations to distinguish lexical meanings, it is natural to examine both the linguistic function and acoustic property of lexical tone, and the current work shows that both aspects affect the lateralization in tone perception, in both early (~200 ms) and late (~400 ms) time windows.

However, the maximum likelihood estimator suffers from overfitting and does not give small model sizes which results in poor performance. We address both of these problems in a single approach. We carry out parameter learning and model minimization simultaneously by optimizing a single objective function that encourages parameter sparsity. Inspired by the MDL principle, we use an objective function for generative models that captures the description of the data by the model (via log-likelihood) and the description of the model (via the L0-norm of the model parameters).

(554, 618, 'Dr Juanita Todd', 'Prediction-error is a term given to events that do not conform to our expectations. Prediction-errors possess motivational salience in that they are capable of capturing attention, directing our behaviour and therefore prompting new learning. The mismatch negativity (MMN) is a prediction-error signal that occurs when a sound fails to match expectations based on an established regularity in the environment. Exposure to repetition leads to the formation of memory-based perceptual inferences about the most probable characteristics of future stimuli. MMN is elicited automatically (even when asleep) if an event does not conform to the inferred characteristics and is studied by measuring auditory evoked potentials. The MMN represents an alert signalling the occurrence of potentially relevant changes or salient events in the environment. It also reflects an updating process that incorporates this recent change into a model of probable features to enable more accurate future predictions. This system therefore ensures an automatic, dynamic and contextually relevant filter of the acoustic environment – a filter that diminishes the influence of events that confirm expectation, and promotes orientation to events that provide new information. MMN is reduced in size in schizophrenia. This reduced size is assumed to have functional consequences as MMN size is generally considered proportional to the degree to which the sounds violates expectations and therefore its potential relevance. The reduction in MMN size is present from first-episode with recent studies indicating that it may also be evident in those at ultra high risk who go on to develop the illness. In this presentation I will discuss research designed to determine why MMN is smaller in schizophrenia and to identify which aspects of prediction-error coding are dysfunctional. I will review research that elevates MMN from a very simple change detection signal into an intelligent inferential process that engages a context-sensitive network to determine relevance. Our most recent work reveals the presence of learning biases that influence automatic attributions of sound relevance. I will use these data to explain how smaller MMN amplitude in schizophrenia could reflect impaired prefrontal monitoring of the adequacy of perceptual inference.', 1332864000, 1332869400, 77, 62, NULL, 'School of Psychology, University of Newcastle.'),

These aftereffects have been found for many of the attributes characterizing natural variations in the face including identity, gender, and expression. We are exploring the impact of adaptation on judgments of facial age. Previously we showed that adaptation to a young or old face shifts the category boundary for classifying an individual as old vs. young. These aftereffects occur for both the textural and shape changes associated with aging, but are more strongly driven by the facial texture. In current work we are exploiting the fact that observers are relatively good at inferring a specific age from a face, so that it is possible to assess how adaptation affects faces drawn from different points throughout the lifespan. This provides a unique metric for examining the actual form of the response changes underlying adaptation to an important dimension of face perception, and I will consider how it can be used to test a number of unresolved questions about face adaptation, such as the role and nature of norms in the adaptation.', 1332158400, 1332162000, 77, 62, NULL, 'Department of Psychology, University of Nevada, Reno, USA.'),

But what is it that they have learned about native AV relations, and how does it bias their responses to non-native speech? An array of theoretical views offer differing hypotheses. The Learned Association view posits that AV associations require experience to develop, i.e., should emerge in older infants only for audio and visual speech patterns that co-occur in native speech (e.g., Kuhl& Meltzoff, 1982; Massaro, 1998). The Intersensory Narrowing account assumes young infants are innately sensitive to intersensory relations in speech, but experience narrows intersensory perception such that older infants remain sensitive only to native AV correspondences (Pons et al., 2009). The Amodal Articulatory Perception account premise is that infants perceive information about the actions of the speech articulators. They can distinguish speech segments by different articulators (between-organ) even in non-native speech, but to distinguish contrasts made by a single articulator (within-organ) they must experience them in native speech (Best & McRoberts, 2003; Goldstein & Fowler, 2003; Tyler et al., 2008). The Perceptual Assimilation Model (PAM: Best, 1995) posits instead developmental changes in infant perception of non-native contrasts depends on whether they perceive them as speech as nonspeech sounds. We therefore tested English-learning infants'' perception of cross-modal articulator congruency in one native and two nonnative between-organ contrasts, one of which English adults hear as speech (ejective stops), the other as nonspeech (clicks). By the Learned Association view, older infants should detect congruency more reliably than younger infants for native speech contrasts, and neither age should do so for nonnative contrasts. But if Intersensory Narrowing is correct, younger infants should detect congruency in native and nonnative contrasts, while older infants should do so only for the native contrast. The Amodal Articulatory account predicts sensitivity to articulator congruency in all between-organ contrasts at both ages, whereas the PAM account predicts different developmental trajectories for non-native contrasts perceived as speech versus contrasts perceived as nonspeech. Results for the nonnative ejective and native contrast support the Amodal Articulatory account, whereas results for the clicks and for the nonnative within-organ contrast used in the prior report (Pons et al., 2009), support the Intersensory Narrowing account. The difference in findings for the two non-native contrasts is compatible with PAM.

In Australian English, rising pitch accents form part of the intonation system and can be characterised phonetically by differences in the coordination of fundamental frequency (F0) peaks and valleys with the segmental string. To date, little research has examined the perception of pitch accents in cochlear implant users. This seminar will focus on the results of three discrimination experiments conducted with an adolescent CI user group. All three experiments used speech stimuli with manipulated F0 contours. Experiment 1 examined the discrimination of level versus rising F0. The CI group easily discriminated between the level F0 contour and rises of 14, 18 and 23 semitones. Experiment 2 examined the discrimination of F0 peaks which differed in alignment with the segmental string. A control group with normal hearing could discriminate between F0 peaks which differed by 40 milliseconds or more. The CI group results were varied, with only a handful of individuals displaying a pattern of results similar to the control group. Experiment 3 saw bilaterally-implanted CI users repeat Experiment 2 in both unilateral and bilateral conditions. No bilateral advantage was evidenced for this task.

But there is a difference between English on the one hand and the other Germanic languages on the other with respect to the occurrence of non-finite wh-questions: while there is a high number of OIs in English in this context, non-finite wh-questions are virtually non-existent in child data of e.g. German or Swedish. This is often argued to be due to the early setting of the V2 parameter: Verb movement only applies to finite verbs and children will therefore produce exclusively finite wh-questions. This paper provides acquisition data showing that this finding also holds for Norwegian. However, considering the variation that exists across languages wrt V2, this paper argues that there is no V2 parameter and that children instead are sensitive to fine syntactic distinctions in the input (micro-cues). On this view, both English and Norwegian have restricted V2 in wh-questions, and the difference between the two languages cannot be due to a parameter setting. The paper also shows that there is no causal correlation between finiteness and word order in this context. Comparing a considerable amount of Norwegian and English child data, it is argued that children’s non-finite root clauses are generally caused by a problem realizing auxiliaries, in both languages, and the difference between English and Norwegian is due to the type of verb typically required in wh-questions (auxiliaries vs. lexical verbs).', 1329913800, 1329917400, 77, 62, NULL, 'Faculty of Humanities, Social Sciences and Education, University of Tromsø, Norway.'),

This motivates a few recent algorithms, which are heavily based on standard algorithms like the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, the Gibbs sampler or the Iterated Batch Importance Sampling algorithm. These algorithms remain "ideal" here because of the intractability of the likelihood. However one can try to "replace" the likelihood values (whenever they are needed during these algorithms) by unbiased estimates obtained by particle filters. These lead to the Particle MCMC methods (Andrieu et al., 2010) and SMC "square" (Chopin et al., 2012).

The opinion of the individual and/or their informant is taken into account by clinicians assessing for dementia, and is part of the diagnostic criteria for the intermediate stage of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). These so-called “subjective cognitive complaints” (SCCs) have not been well validated or operationalised however. Further, while some studies have found SCCs predict progression to dementia, to date there has been no evaluation of which type (participant/informant, memory/non-memory) or severity of complaints are most sensitive to progression to dementia, or indeed progression from normal to MCI. In the current studies we aimed to examine the relationship between SCCs and objective cognitive impairment, the influence of mood and personality variables, and to assess whether SCCs at baseline could predict cognitive decline or diagnostic classification at two year follow-up. Methods: Participants were drawn from the Sydney Memory and Ageing Study, a longitudinal study of 1037 community-dwelling older adults initially aged 70-90 years. A subsample of 637 participants who completed a comprehensive assessment including 15 memory and 9 non-memory complaint questions, personality and mood questionnaires, and neuropsychological testing at baseline were included. An informant answered 15 memory and 4 non-memory complaint questions, and rated their functional independence. Each participant was classified into normal, MCI, or dementia groups. Repeat testing was conducted two years later. Results: Overall, 95.5% of participants or their informants endorsed at least one SCC at baseline. Informants were most accurate in endorsing a complaint when objective cognitive impairment was present. Regression analysis showed that psychological factors explained the number of complaints more than cognitive performance. Participant memory complaints predicted MCI, and sum of informant memory complaints predicted dementia two years later. Informant memory complaints also predicted decline in memory scores and global cognitive scores over two years. Conclusion: We question the usefulness of SCCs as a criterion for MCI at a single time point due to their high prevalence and their relationship to psychological factors. They seem more useful longitudinally however.

In recent years a number of papers have been published showing an apparent impairment in holistic processing of other-race faces, using paradigms such as the part-whole task or the composite task. Using data collected from Hong Kong Chinese and Australia Caucasian participants, I will argue that the case for a perceptual basis for the ORE appears to have been over-stated.

In this talk I will focus on one central facet of cognitive control: the ability to update behaviour following changes in the environment. Psychological theories have argued that behavioural updating requires the activation of task goals that drive lower systems. For instance, when updating requires behavioural inhibition, the control system activates a â€˜stopâ€™ goal to countermand planned or ongoing motor activity. Other forms of updating can involve the programming and selection of alternative responses and the reorienting of selective attention. A convergence of evidence suggests that behavioural updating is supported by a distributed neural network, with a central hub in the prefrontal cortex. Yet precisely how this network supports updating is controversial and poorly understood. In this talk I will summarise some of our recent studies, which contrasted competing accounts of prefrontal updating using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Our findings confirm that the right inferior frontal cortex is crucial for behavioural updating, but that contrary to previous suggestions it is not uniquely important for inhibiting behaviour. Instead, the IFJ appears to be important for updating the focus of visual attention while the more ventral IFG (pars opercularis) updates corresponding action plans â€“ regardless of whether such plans are inhibitory or excitatory.

The contribution of hereditary characteristics and the importance of practice, instruction, and the mentorship of significant others such as parents and coaches are often debated. A common or lay opinion is that elite performers are born rather than made, creating the perception that less â€˜giftedâ€™ individuals may continually strive to reach excellence without making the necessary gains needed to become experts in the domain. However, recent research in the sport and cognitive sciences has indicated that individuals achieve excellence through many hours of deliberate, purposeful practice with the specific intention of improving performance. Typically, for example, elite athletes have to devote in excess of 10,000 hours of practice to achieve excellence, regardless of sport. This commitment and continual engagement in practice is the most important determining factor on the path to excellence. Hereditary factors may also be important in helping individuals develop the necessary â€˜rage to masterâ€™ (i.e., the commitment and motivation to persist in practice over many years).

The first study shows that when one stimulus is neutral and the other is a learned danger signal, infusion of the GABAA agonist, muscimol, or the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAr) antagonist, ifenprodil, into the BLA impairs associative formation. However, when both stimuli are neutral, acquisition and extinction of the association between them is unaffected by manipulations targeting the BLA.

The third and final study shows that fear shifts processing of an association between neutral stimuli from the PRh to the BLA: when training is conducted in a dangerous environment, formation and extinction of an association between two neutral stimuli is impaired by BLA inactivation or blockade of NMDAr, but unaffected by PRh inactivation. These double dissociations in the roles of the PRh and BLA in learning under different stimulus and environmental conditions imply that fear-induced activation of the amygdala changes how the brain processes sensory stimuli: Harmless stimuli are treated as potentially harmful, resulting in a shift from cortical to subcortical processing in the BLA.', 1357920000, 1357923600, 78, 63, NULL, 'University of New South Wales'),

I have recently introduced a novel computational approach to surface perception, known as gamut relativity, which provides a unified perspective on the processes underlying surface lightness, transparency and gloss perception. It does so by rejecting the assumption of ‘reification’—the assumption that the dimensional structure of the representation of the physical world corresponds to the dimensional structure of the physical world itself—that is widespread in psychology and neuroscience. The theory instead posits that the form of the representation underlying surface perception is more closely related to the computational division of the visual brain into parallel ON and OFF channels. This representation takes the form of a perceptual blackness-whiteness space in which a process of vector decomposition plays the key computational role. According to this view, surface lightness emerges in terms of the relationships between points falling on different black-to-white ‘gamut’ lines in blackness-whiteness space, each representing different illumination, transparency or gloss levels. In this talk, I show how gamut relativity explains some striking demonstrations of surface lightness and transparency perception recently investigated by Anderson and colleagues.

(615, 679, 'Prof Rick Richardson', 'Mental health problems are often assumed to have their roots in early-life experiences. For example, modern theories have emphasised the importance of early learning experiences in the development of adult anxiety disorders. However, memories acquired in infancy are rapidly forgotten in nearly all species (including humans). Further, recent pre-clinical research has shown that extinction of learned fear (which is the empirical basis for exposure-based therapies) leads to a loss of fear that is relatively relapse-resistant in infants. Neither of these findings fit well with the assumption that early experiences significantly contribute to later mental health problems. However, we have recently shown that early life stress (induced by maternal separation) alters the developmental trajectory for both the memory retention and the fear inhibition systems in the developing rat. That is, animals repeatedly separated from their mother early in life exhibit an earlier transition to the adult-like retention and extinction systems. In other words, these animals exhibit much longer-lasting memory than their standard-reared peers, and they also exhibit relapse-prone extinction. Further, we have also found that the infant offspring of males previously exposed to the maternal separation procedure exhibit the same developmental shifts observed in their fathers, even though they were not exposed to any early life stress. These results suggest that behavioural phenotypes putatively involved in vulnerability to later life anxiety are transmitted from father to offspring and can be detected very early in development, which is of clinical relevance for targeting and developing preventative treatments for mental health problems.', 1370793600, 1370797200, 78, 63, NULL, 'University of New South Wales'),

My research focuses on testing and developing models of the cognitive processes involved in attention, learning, memory, and decision-making. In this talk, I will discuss two projects that use models to leverage insight about different aspects of visual cognition. The first characterizes the storage capacity of visual short-term memory (VSTM) using classic signal detection models. The key analysis reveals how changes in the precision of VSTM representations under increasing memory load can be explained, in a parameter-free way, by a so-called “sample size” model. Theoretically, the result favors normalization models of VSTM that assume allocation of a finite pool of resources across stimuli. The second project investigates individual differences in the implicit learning processes thought to underpin the contextual cuing effect in visual search (i.e., the reduction in search time for arrays surreptitiously repeated over the course of an experiment, relative to novel arrays). Choice response time data were modeled using different versions of Ratcliff’s diffusion model.

This has been attributed to exposure allowing the comparison of the relevant stimuli, which in turn affords the extraction of the discriminating features. The early visual cortex and other brain areas (such as the prefrontal cortex) have been implicated in such perceptual learning effects; but the anatomical specificity within visual cortex and the relationship between sensory cortex and other brain areas has yet to be examined. Today, I begin by considering the fact that increasing the opportunity for comparison by manipulating the exposure schedule improves perceptual learning, while decreasing the opportunity for comparison using distracting stimuli attenuates perceptual learning. In addition, in an event-related fMRI study, participants were exposed to confusable pairs of faces, scenes and dot patterns, using either intermixed or blocked presentation schedules. Stimulus independent activation, correlated with the overall perceptual learning advantage was seen in frontal areas (e.g. frontal and supplementary eye fields and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) and in early visual cortex (V1-4). In all cases, the difference in activation between exposed and novel stimuli decreased as a function of the amount of perceptual learning. Overall levels of activation differed across regions, consistent with the possibility that, as perceptual learning progresses, processing shifts from initial engagement of early visual regions to higher order visual areas. Similar relationships were observed when contrasting intermixed with blocked exposure, suggesting that the opportunity for comparison primarily influences the amount, rather than the nature, of perceptual learning.', 1360339200, 1360342800, 78, 63, NULL, 'Cardiff University'),

These characteristics lend themselves ideallyto a D-type analysis (Heim 1990, Elbourne 2005). The semantics of causers supplies an event variable that co-varies with respect to the quantifier (cf. Williams 1994). This event denotes a situation of a ‘size’ (Kratzer 2007) suitable for interpreting the pronoun as D-type, which is just a co-varying definite description.

Thus, the repertoire of children’s phonological knowledge is multifaceted and includes at least the following three aspects as proposed by Pierrehumbert (2003), Munson, Edwards, & Beckman (2005), and Beckman, Munson, & Edwards (2007): 1) language-specific defining acoustic features, 2) social-indexical knowledge, and 3) lexical-based phonological knowledge.

However, studies where phonetic or phonological variables are remeasured for individuals at times years apart have found huge variability: there is often no evidence for any change for a majority of individuals, while a minority change significantly (e.g. Harrington, 2006; Evans & Iverson, 2007; Sankoff & Blondeau, 2007).

We consider five variables in six hours of speech from 12 speakers, and analyze each variable''s dynamics over the course of the season after controlling for linguistic factors. Variability is the norm: speakers and variables show four qualitatively different types of time dependence, with a significant minority showing stability. There is some evidence that particular speakers (across variables) and particular variables (across speakers) show characteristic types of time dependence.

The opposite is true of French: most monosyllables that end in [al] keep their base faithful under afixation (e.g. bal ~ bal ‘ball(s)’), while most polysyllables tolerate a stem change (bokal ~ boko‘jar(s)’). In this talk, I examine the two types of languages, and show that the symmetry is only superficial. The French trend is accessible to the grammar and extends readily to novel words, whereas English speakers treatnovel words the same regardless of size. In other words, English speakers fail to find the generalization (the surfeit of the stimulus, Becker et al. 2011).Positional faithfulness, and in particular,initial syllable faithfulness explains thisasymmetry: The [al] in bal is protected by initial syllable faithfulness and by general faithfulness, while the [al] in bokal is protected by general faithfulness only. English goes against the Universal bias, requiring monosyllables to be less faithful than polysyllables. But with general faithfulness highly ranked, the ranking of initial syllable faithfulness is irrelevant, and the speakers are blocked from forming the required generalization.Having established the asymmetry in the novel word tasks, we press English speakers further and ask them to learn unfamiliar morphophonological alternations (e.g. miː p~ miː b-ni). Unencumbered by the counter-typological nature of actual English, speakers revert to Universal Grammar, and exhibit the French pattern.This line of investigation, which goes from real words to novel words and from novel words to novel alternations, allows us to trace the biases that humans use in the phonological organization of their lexicon, and allows us to expose behavior that roundly contradicts the ambient language, yet conforms to the trends we see in the world’s languages.', 1330345800, 0, 79, 65, 0, 'University of Massachusetts, Amherst'),

Not only can they account for where variation is observed and where not, but they also often predict the frequencies with which different variants are observed very accurately. This is usually presented as reason for celebration.“We have solved the problem of variation!”In this presentation, I will argue that thiscelebration may be premature. These models of variation are all exclusively grammatical. Variation, on the other hand, has beendemonstrated by decades of research in the variationist sociolinguistic paradigm to beinfluenced by grammar and many other factors. If an exclusively grammatical modelaccounts for all aspects of phonological variation, it therefore does more than its fairshare of the work. It is then not an accurate model of the system in the minds of speakersthat is responsible for producing variation.I will illustrate this with two examples from English: (i) variable word-final t/d-deletion(west→west/wes_), and (ii) variable schwa deletion (potato→potato/p_tato). Both ofthese processes are influenced by typical grammatical factors. But they are also bothsubject by factors that would not usually be deemed part of grammar. My particular focus in this presentation will be on the contribution of usage frequency and speech rate to the application of variable phonologicalprocesses. (i) Frequency: Two words that are equivalent in all relevant phonological properties but differ in usage frequency may be influenced rather differently by these processes. For instance, t/d-deletion is much more likely from very frequent just than from phonologically similar but infrequent bust. (ii)Speech rate: The exact same word may be treated very differently by these processes based on the rate of speech. For instance, schwa deletion is more likely at faster than slower speech rates for all words. I will propose a model of the phonological competence of language users that allows bothtypical grammatical factors and non-grammatical factors to impact how language users produce and perceive speech. This model will be developed in an augmented version of Harmonic Grammar.', 1328283000, 0, 79, 65, NULL, 'University of Michigan'),
(647, 711, 'Kathleen Currie Hall', 'In this talk, I address the problem of phonological relationships that seem to be intermediate between contrast and allophony. Allophony (in which two sounds are predictably distributed all of the time) and contrast (in which two sounds are unpredictably distributed at least some of the time) have traditionally been assumed to be binarily and categorically distinct. There are, however, a large number of intermediate relationships in the world’s languages that apparently affect both phonological and perceptual patterns. Such relationships have generally been marginalized in the phonological literature and given names such as “quasi-allophones” or “marginal contrasts.”I present a new model of phonological relationships that redefines these relationships along a continuum, from fully predictable to never predictable. Intermediate relationships can be defined at all points along this continuum, and the precise relationship between any two sounds in a language can be quantified. The continuum is largely based on the information-theoretic concept of entropy, a measure of the uncertainty that exists in the choice among any set of items. This model can be used to describe the synchronic state of phonological relationships and to track changes in progress or variation across speakers. Additionally, using uncertainty as the basis for modeling phonological relationships provides a cognitively based explanation for the observation that contrastive sounds are perceptually more distinct than allophonic ones, or more precisely, that the more unpredictably distributed a pair of sounds is, the more perceptually distinct that pair will be.', 1338726600, 0, 79, 65, 0, 'CUNY: The College of Staten Island & The Graduate Center'),

On the other hand, the concept of desire is held to develop much earlier. Thus, children do not have the same difficulties with verbs reporting desires than with those reporting beliefs.

By 10-12 months they show attunement to phonetic variations that are relevant in their language, and declining sensitivity to distinctions that are irrelevant to it, laying the cornerstone for mature listeners’ rapid and automatic recognition of native words. But what makes a phonetic distinction ‘relevant’ versus ‘irrelevant?’ The answer lies in how listeners relate the phonetic details of a word to its phonological structure, while taking into account the extensive phonetic variations in a given word across talkers, speech styles, and regional accents. Those phonetic variations are not “noise,” instead providing crucial information about two complementary principles that together define the phonological structure of words. One principle is phonological distinctiveness, which refers to language-specific minimal contrasts that meaningfully distinguish otherwise identical spoken forms. The complementary principle is phonological constancy, which permits listeners to recognize a word across talker and accent differences. A spoken word’s structure is co-defined by the phonetic variations that alter its phonological form and those that leave it intact.

Phonetic accommodation was measured using both a perceptual similarity task and acoustic measurements. The results indicate that speakers who were less merged in baseline productions were able to further unmerge in response to the Australian model. The degree to which New Zealanders accommodated to the Australian model was also affected by individuals'' social biases toward Australia. The results suggest that the degree of merger can be lessened when exposed to an unmerged model, but that those who are more fully merged do not unmerge spontaneously.

Prominent positions tend to be characterized by having more robust phonetic cues or a wide range ofphonological contrasts, while non-prominent positions have weaker cues and fewer contrasts (e.g., Beckman 1999, Smith 2000). Prominence, however, has often been used as an explanation (e.g., there are more contrasts in certain “strong” positions because they are psycholinguistically or phonetically prominent; see Beckman 1999), rather than a phenomenon which must itself be explained. In this talk, we examine what it actually means to be a prominent position and what would cause some positions to be considered prominent while others are not. In particular, we claim that prominent and non-prominentpositions are those that are strategic from the perspective of communication.We take as a starting assumption that language is a type of communication, i.e., the transmission of a message from one point to another, and therefore subject to the same considerations as other systems of communication (cf. Shannon & Weaver 1949). As a general proposition, successful information transmission is dependent on the resolution of uncertainty in the mapping between the signal and the message, and in language, the phonetic signal is manipulated in order to maximize the effectiveness of thistransmission.

Prominent positions tend to be characterized by having more robust phonetic cues or a wide range ofphonological contrasts, while non-prominent positions have weaker cues and fewer contrasts (e.g., Beckman 1999, Smith 2000). Prominence, however, has often been used as an explanation (e.g., there are more contrasts in certain “strong” positions because they are psycholinguistically or phonetically prominent; see Beckman 1999), rather than a phenomenon which must itself be explained. In this talk, we examine what it actually means to be a prominent position and what would cause some positions to be considered prominent while others are not. In particular, we claim that prominent and non-prominentpositions are those that are strategic from the perspective of communication.We take as a starting assumption that language is a type of communication, i.e., the transmission of a message from one point to another, and therefore subject to the same considerations as other systems of communication (cf.

Normalization or compensation processes for coping with specific sources of variability have been proposed as solutions to this context dependency. In this talk, I will argue that the lack of invariance is not a major obstacle. I will use the English fricatives as a test case to demonstrate that variability can be overcome by the use of multiple acoustic cues and a relatively simple compensation scheme by which cues are recoded relative to expectations derived from context. I will also provide results from clearly produced fricatives to show that speakers not only are aware of the contrasts in their phonetic inventory and make a general effort to maintain these contrasts but also attempt to preserve contrast at a more local level, adapting on line in response to perception errors.

However, while some reported that habenula lesions produce avoidance deficits, others have found that the lesions reduce the avoidance deficits caused by inescapable shock.

We show that juvenile zebrafish learn to avoid a predictable electric shock when it is escapable, but fail to do so when pre-exposed to inescapable shock. Perturbation of specific habenula neurons leads to a similar failure in avoidance.

(728, 792, 'Dr. Nina Powell', 'There are reasons why condemnation might outweigh praise, both as a topic of study and as a driving force in moral judgement. First, there is a well-documented “negativity bias” in human information processing (Jordan, 1965; Baumeister, Bratslavsky, Finkenauer, & Vohs, 2001), which might support greater attention to moral vice than moral virtue (and which might have even prompted more research interest in condemnation than praise). Relatedly, a wealth of evidence suggests that people are averse to loss (e.g., Kahneman & Tversky, 1979; Tversky & Kahneman, 1986), to the extent that they are even more motivated to avoid a loss than acquire a gain (e.g., Tversky & Kahneman, 1992), which suggests that individuals should generally be more motivated to avoid condemnation than earn praise.Apart from evidence demonstrating a “negativity bias” in human information processing (Jordan, 1965; Baumeister, Bratslavsky, Finkenauer, & Vohs, 2001), along with evidence suggesting that people use dishonest behavior as a better indicator of personality than honest behavior (McGraw, 1985; Reeder & Coovert, 1986; Skowronski & Carlston, 1989), there is some preliminary evidence to suggest that full-blown positive moral emotion (i.e., including its behavioural correlates) may require a substantial knowledge/information base. Research has demonstrated that feelings of elevation in response to witnessing virtuous behaviour can lead to helping behaviour (Schnall, Roper, & Fessler, 2010). In our own research, however, we have found that helping behaviour does not result from witnessing the virtuous behaviour in isolation, but also requires having knowledge of either a positive outcome for the help recipient or praise of the helper (Powell, Zumbé, & Quinn, in preparation-b). This evidence suggests that the positive effects of witnessing morally virtuous behaviour are reliant on more knowledge than was previously thought, suggesting that people are in need of extensive proof and confirmation of virtue.In an effort to directly compare virtue and vice, and their respective evidentiary standards, we predicted that people would show different attention to, and engagement with, information about moral vice compared to moral virtue. We directly compared vignettes depicting moral virtue and moral vice, as well as self-generated examples of virtue and vice. We found that participants reported a greater interest in judging virtue compared to vice, and believed that actors behaving virtuously were more likely to act with a goal in mind than actors behaving viciously. In a follow-up study, we found that when we included a morally neutral control scenario and asked participants to judge wrongness and make inferences about moral character relating to the moral foundations theory (Haidt & Joseph, 2004), participants had a hard time differentiating between neutrality and goodness, but could clearly identify and infer badness. This suggests that a) the asymmetry between moral virtue and moral vice may be found in preferences for information and inferences about intentionality rather than in explicit judgments of goodness and badness, b) that there is a positivity bias or a positive baseline for morality, and c) that perhaps moral acts need to be exemplary in order to be differentiated from acts of general goodness.', 1379505600, 1379509200, 81, 67, 0, ''),

This approach is sensible because there must be a minimal necessary neural development that makes pain possible. Very broadly, it is generally agreed that the minimal necessary neural pathways for pain are in place by 24 weeks gestation. Arguments remain, however, as to the possibility of fetal pain before or after 24 weeks. Some argue that the fetus can feel pain earlier than 24 weeks because pain can be supported by subcortical structures. Others argue that the fetus cannot feel pain at any stage because the fetus is maintained in a state of sedation in the womb and lacks further neural and conceptual development necessary for pain. Much of this argument rests on the definition of terms such as ‘wakefulness’ and ‘pain’. If a behavioural and neural reaction to a noxious stimulus is considered sufficient for pain then pain is possible from 24 weeks and probably much earlier. If a conceptual subjectivity is considered necessary for pain, however, then pain is not possible at any gestational age. Regardless of how pain is defined it is clear that pain for conceptual beings is qualitatively different than pain for non-conceptual beings.

Several proposals exist, and I will focus on the role of experience. I will describe our recent study where two groups of participants took part in two different learning regimens requiring either subordinate-level individuation or basic-level categorization of a set of novel, artificial objects (Ziggerins). Individuation training involved learning to categorize Ziggerins at a subordinate level quickly, similar to how people discriminate faces during person identification. Categorization training involved learning to rapidly recognize at the basic level Ziggerins that were presented in spatially organized arrays with coherent styles, similar to how people process letters when reading a text. The two regimens resulted in different patterns of changes in fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) responses. After individuation training Ziggerins were processed holistically and provoked higher activity in the fusiform gyrus, i.e., they are processed like faces. In contrast, categorization training resulted in more fluent processing of multiple objects, as well as increased recruitment of the medial portion of the ventral occipito-temporal cortex relative to more lateral areas.

Although the FFM has generated much empirical data, substantive objections to the FFM have been raised in relation both to the validity of dimensional models generally (e.g., McAdams, 1992), and to the psychometric evidence more specifically (Block, 1995; Boyle, 2008).

In the first part I will talk about a heuristic underlying the effect of value (desirability, monetary incentive, etc.) on judgment. I will show that people infer scarcity of an object from their personal desire, or valuation of it. In the second part, I will propose a two-process model of the effect of motivation (desire, needs, etc) on judgment. According to this model, motivation leads to two opposite effects. One is wishful thinking, in which people’s evaluation is assimilated toward their motivated expectation. The other is a contrast effect, in which people use their motivated expectation as a reference point to evaluate reality. I further propose that ownership status determines the relative weight of the two processes. This model reconciles opposite findings from myself and from New Look psychologists such as Bruner & Goodman (1947).

Such a view of phonological development makes many assumptions. For example, it assumes that children’s phonological learning is best described in terms of alphabetic transcription; that patterns of phonological development are the same across different languages; and that phonological development depends largely on the learner and not on the characteristics of the input they receive. In this talk, I will present analyses from a set of experiments that were conducted in collaboration with a large set of colleagues.The first set of experiments examines the utilities and pitfalls of using phonetic transcription as the primary tool to study speech-sound development. I will review evidence that the acquisition of speech sounds is a continuous process of phonetic differentiation that begins early in life, and extends far beyond the point at which children produce words that are rated to sound adult-like. I will present the results of a set of experiments aimed at developing perceptual techniques for measuring children''s gradual differentiation in speech sounds.The second set of experiments examines cross-linguistic studies of children''s speech-sound development. In particular, I will focus on a set of studies that show that apparent cross-linguistic differences in children''s phonological acquisition can be accounted for, in part, by cross-linguistic differences in adults'' perception of children''s'' speech.The final set of experiments examines associations between adults'' perception of children''s speech and their subsequent models to children. These experiments show that adults subtly modify their speech in response to children''s productions that they perceive to be incorrect. I argue these modifications serve the dual functions of giving the children hyper-correct input (similar to that of child-directed speech), as well as error-corrective feedback to children.', 1286881200, 0, 75, 59, NULL, 'Ph.D., The Ohio State UniversityAssociate ProfessorDepartment of Speech-Language-Hearing Sciences'),

This theory deduces that the alphabetic and the Chinese scripts represent two and the only two destinations of written language evolution, with one deeply rooted in human audition and the other in human vision.

In this seminar, I present three studies which investigated the processing of ambiguous morpheme. First, I compared morphological processing in word recognition and production. Although ambiguous morphemes are involved, the temporal dynamics differed remarkably across tasks. Second, I contrasted the processing of ambiguous morphemes with opaque words (e.g., "intact", where "in-" did not contribute to word meaning). Results suggest that opaque words were treated like the less frequent meaning of the ambiguous morpheme. Therefore, by assuming a continuum of meaning productivity, effects of morphemic ambiguity and semantic transparency can be unified. Finally, the eye tracker was used to monitor how morphemic ambiguity was resolved. While all meanings were initially activated, context could moderate the strength of activation.

Moreover, when cultural differences in aging occur, they are usually consistent with known cultural differences in values. These findings inspire me to argue that socioemotional development across adulthood may be part of a life-long socialization process: Individuals in each culture learn to be better members of their culture as they grow older.

We investigated the role of sleep and circadian rhythms in the regulation of ongoing performance as well as memory consolidation. Our data revealed that cognitive performance during total sleep deprivation was affected by both the circadian and the homeostatic processes such that prior repeated partial sleep loss exacerbated the cognitive decline, but this effect was virtually absent in the evening and most prominent during the early morning hours. However, cognitive vulnerability during sleep loss was not uniform across all cognitive domains and varied widely across individuals with such individual differences predicted by a variable number tandem repeat polymorphism in a clock gene – PERIOD3. In contrast to the importance of the two processes in regulating ongoing cognitive performance during wakefulness , we only found evidence for a homeostatic, but not a circadian, modulation of sleep’s facilitative effect on the consolidation of declarative memory.

(755, 819, 'Prof. John X. Zhang', 'The centro-parietal N200 is a new brain wave we first observed three years ago. It is a negative deflection in event-related potentials (ERP) elicited by two-character Chinese words around 200 milliseconds after their presentation, most salient in central and parietal brain regions. Here we summarize the over thirty experiments we have conducted so far on this ERP response to present convincing evidence that it is a real discovery beyond any reasonable doubt. Evidence shows that the N200 is sensitive to orthographic but not semantic, or phonological manipulations and can also be demonstrated for single characters as basic units in written Chinese. Coding the visual form at the radical and character levels, as well as the word level, the N200 is argued to be a neural marker that distinguishes word recognition in Chinese and alphabetic scripts, a marker that researchers on reading have been looking for in the past three decades. This marker allows us for the first time to answer for the Chinese script one of the fundamental questions in reading research, i.e., when is the visual form of a word recognized? Albeit many years’ of investigation, answer to the same question for alphabetic scripts remains elusive.Presently, no theory seems able to accommodate the N200 phenomenon and its specificity to Chinese except the meaning-spelling theory the speaker proposed in 201l, which posits that Chinese and alphabetic scripts are rooted in different sensory modalities and constitute a dichotomy among all human writing systems. Characteristics of the centro-parietal N200, such as early onset, robustness, salience, and specificity to orthography and to the Chinese language, suggests a possibility of our leaping into a new level of understanding of visual word recognition, and possibly of reading in general.', 1329476400, 0, 75, 59, NULL, 'Ph.D. of Princeton UniversityAssistant ProfessorDepartment of PsychologyThe Chinese University of Hong Kong'),

(773, 837, 'Dr. Jian Huang', 'Semantic processing during sentence comprehension involves retrieving the meanings of individual words and integrating those meanings into larger semantic units. However, the temporal and spatial dynamics of the neural mechanisms underlying these semantic processes remain unclear. The N400 component of the event-related brain potential (ERP) has long been considered as an important index of semantic processing. In this talk I will present findings from neuroimaging studies using various methods (i.e., ERP, functional magnetic resonance imaging or fMRI, and event-related optical signals or EROS) on the brain activation patterns related to semantic processing within, before, and after the N400 time window. I will also discuss the theoretical implications of the obtained results.', 1386068400, 0, 75, 59, NULL, 'Ph.D.PostDoc Fellow, Department of PsychologyThe Chinese University of Hong Kong'),
